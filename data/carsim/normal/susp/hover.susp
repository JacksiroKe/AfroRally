# spring-factor-n = x, y
#   x - suspension displacement in meters (relative to the "zero force" position)
#   y - factor to be applied to the spring coefficient

# damper-factor-n = x,y
#   x - is an absolute value of suspension velocity in m/s
#   y - is the factor to be applied to the damping coefficient,
#  	    (bounce or rebound, depending on the direction of travel).
